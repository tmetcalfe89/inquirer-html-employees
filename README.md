# Purpose

To demonstrate how to create a CLI tool to collect information, then output it to a file.

## Topics

- Classes (OOP) in JavaScript.
- CLI input in Node JS.
- Template literals (template strings) in JavaScript.

## Tools

[inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

## This branch

This branch uses Common JS module implementations, which are the default in Node JS. In order to do this, I am using v8.x.x of inquirer, as v9.x.x+ uses ES6 module implementations exclusively.
